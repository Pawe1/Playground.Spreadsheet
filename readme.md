# Simple spreadsheet-like... uhm... thing

*As rough, as simple and bare-bone as possible.*

*No IOC. No webservices and no cloud hosted backend.*

*[Also no GUI and (almost) no trace of 3rd parity references.]*

**Totally pure experience.**

## Limitations / assumptions / etc

* *all tokens must be separated by spaces*
* constant spreadsheet size (256 x 256)
* cell references can contain only 1 letter
* ***Thou shalt not make circular references!***
* Support only for absolute cell references
* Excel-like cell addressing
